## Hi there üëã
I'm Debby Prasetyady, I am very interested in programming, and I am currently studying several programming languages which will certainly help build my career in the future. The programming language I'm currently using is:
| Rank | Languages | Platform |
|-----:|-----------|----------|
|     1| PHP       | Laravel  |
|     2| Dart      | Flutter  |
|     3| Javascript|          |
|     4| SQL       |          |

I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in informatics engineering with a GPA of 3.01 out of 4 at Siliwangi University and had a project management certificate (ICT Management) from 2018 to 2021 through the Professional Certification Institute at my campus in collaboration with the National Professional Certification Agency (BNSP).

The projects that I have worked on can be seen in my repository and all are private because they are related to the company I used to work for. However, you can see the appearance of some of these projects as follows:

In my thesis project, I created a decision support system using the Web-based Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method and using the Laravel platform.
