## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Debby Prasetyady, I am very interested in programming, and I am currently studying several programming languages which will certainly help build my career in the future. The programming language I'm currently using is:
| Rank | Languages | Platform |
|-----:|-----------|----------|
|     1| PHP       | Laravel  |
|     2| Dart      | Flutter  |
|     3| Javascript|          |
|     4| SQL       |          |

I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in informatics engineering with a GPA of 3.01 out of 4 at Siliwangi University and had a project management certificate (ICT Management) from 2018 to 2021 through the Professional Certification Institute at my campus in collaboration with the National Professional Certification Agency (BNSP).

## Project be done
The projects that I have worked on can be seen in my repository and all are private because they are related to the company I used to work for. However, you can see the appearance of some of these projects as follows:
<br>

* **Thesis Project**

In my thesis project, I created a decision support system using the Web-based Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method and using the Laravel platform.

SIMASIP is an application that helps in managing student thesis from beginning to end. Because there are shortcomings, the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences asks to add several features to complete the application including the message feature between lecturers and students, the thesis proposal submission feature, the thesis proposal trial feature, increasing the number of examiners, thesis title CRUD, determining the seminar session schedule , and a few other little things.
